    "introduction": "Electricity and magnetism play a very important role in our daily life. They are closely connected and together form the basis of many devices and technologies we use today, like motors, generators, and transformers. This Electricity & Magnetism Virtual Lab helps students understand the basic concepts of electric current, magnetic fields, and how they interact with each other.<br>The lab includes interesting experiments such as the Tangent Galvanometer to measure electric current, and the Magnetic Field along the axis of a circular coil to study how magnetic field changes with distance. Students can also learn about Earthâ€™s magnetic field using a Deflection Magnetometer, explore high voltage using the Van de Graaff Generator, and understand how temperature affects resistance. Through these virtual activities, students can visualize and learn the principles of electromagnetism in a simple and engaging way.",
